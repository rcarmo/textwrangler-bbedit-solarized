Installation
------------

Starting in BBEdit 10.0 and TextWrangler 4.0, you can use the .bbcolors files without using any command-line tools - just place the .bbcolor files here into your `~/Library/Application\ Support/BBEdit/Color\ Schemes/` or `~/Library/Application Support/TextWrangler/Color Schemes` directory.

But if you're a command-line person, just do:

    cp *.bbcolors ~/Library/Application\ Support/BBEdit/Color\ Schemes/
    
or, for TextWrangler:

    cp *.bbcolors ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextWrangler/Color\ Schemes/

...and then got to BBEdit/TextWrangler preferences and pick the color scheme in "Text Colors".

Since TextWrangler (older than to 4.0) and BBEdit (older than version 10) don't allow you to save theme files separately, these `.bbcolor` files are generated by John Gruber's [BBColors][b] utility (bundled for your convenience), which manipulates their preferences file directly.

To install these, place the files in `~/Library/Application\ Support/BBColors` and, with TextWrangler/BBEdit *closed*, invoke [BBColors][b] thusly:

1.  For BBEdit (< version 10):

        ./bbcolors -load "Solarized Dark"

2.  For TextWrangler (< version 4):

        ./bbcolors -load "Solarized Light" -tw
